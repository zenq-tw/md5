# TW MD5 - Digest Library for TW Embedded Lua

> Original repo: https://lunarmodules.github.io/md5/

Library offers basic digest facilities for Lua 5.1.

Version of MD5 is 1.3.

Original version modified by me to add MD5 checksum calculation for use in TW: WH3 mods. 

List of changes:
  * Improved usability
  * Removed all irrelevant features
  * A small amount of optimizations (should be)
  * Implemented DLL proxying to support statically linked (embedded) Lua in a host process (WH3)
  * A little more tests)

## Usage

```lua
md5 = require('md5')    -- md5.dll must be under your LUA_CPATH

--    !!! WARNING !!!
-- We have to link to embedded Lua C Api ourselves at runtime, because CA didnt give us access to lua.dll and instead linked Lua statically.
--  => we cant raise error if module initialization fails (no access to lua_error/luaL_error functions)
assert(type(md5) == 'table', 'Failed to load md5 module (troubles with Lua C API linkage?)')  


checksum = md5.calculate('some string')
print(checksum)         -- -> 5ac749fbeec93607fc28d666be85e73a

-- 'MD5Context' allows you to perform iterative checksum calculation.
-- Useful for processing files or any streaming content.
-- Call 'update()' for each new content chunk and 'calculate()' whenewher you want
md5_context = md5.new()
md5_context:update('ABC')
md5_context:update('DEFG')
md5_context:update('H')

checksum = md5_context:calculate()  -- same as md5.calculate('ABCDEFGH')
print(checksum)       -- -> 4783e784b4fa2fba9e4d6502dbc64f8f

md5_context:update('12')
md5_context:update('34')

checksum = md5_context:calculate()    -- same as md5.calculate('ABCDEFGH1234')
print(checksum)       -- -> c9552f2ccf723bbb3957a423fc032494
```

## Build
All Makefiles are configured for MinGW and only for Windows.

After calling `build` you will find shared library `md5.dll` under path `build\md5.dll`.

```powershell
mingw32-make.exe build
```

You can test the built library by calling `test`.


```powershell
mingw32-make.exe test
```

## Future plans
* Try to compile with native Windows compiler - this should reduce .dll file and eliminate dependency on MSVCRT (static linkage)


## History

### Version 2.1.0 [18/Apr/2023] 

* Pack created .dll file into .lua script


### Version 2.0.0 [14/Apr/2023] 

Initial release of forked version. 

Key differences from original (v1.2):
1. Support only Lua 5.1 and Windows
2. Removed all non-digest related features
3. Fixed iterative calculation of MD5 checksums (should work now)
4. Provided `MD5Context` class in Lua to encapsulate iterative checksum calculations
5. Embedded lua support

### Version 1.2 [06/Sep/2013]

* Code adapted to compile for Lua 5.0, 5.1 and 5.2

### Version 1.1.2 [12/May/2008]

* Fixed bug in 64-bit systems
* Fixed the Windows makefile to accept longer directory names
  (patch by Alessandro Hecht and Ignacio BurgueÃ±o).
