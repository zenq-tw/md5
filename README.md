# MD5 - Digest Library for Lua 5.1

> Original repo: https://lunarmodules.github.io/md5/

Library offers basic digest facilities for Lua 5.1.

Version of MD5 is 1.3.

Original version modified by me to add MD5 checksum calculation for use in TW: WH3 mods. Improved usability and removed all irrelevant features.

## Usage

```lua
md5 = require('md5')    -- md5.dll must be under your LUA_CPATH

checksum = md5.calculate('some string')
print(checksum)         -- -> 5ac749fbeec93607fc28d666be85e73a

-- 'MD5Context' allows you to perform iterative checksum calculation.
-- Useful for processing files or any streaming content.
-- Call 'update()' for each new content chunk and 'calculate()' whenewher you want
md5_context = md5.new()
md5_context:update('ABC')
md5_context:update('DEFG')
md5_context:update('H')

checksum = md5_context:calculate()  -- same as md5.calculate('ABCDEFGH')
print(checksum)       -- -> 4783e784b4fa2fba9e4d6502dbc64f8f

md5_context:update('12')
md5_context:update('34')

checksum = md5_context:calculate()    -- same as md5.calculate('ABCDEFGH1234')
print(checksum)       -- -> c9552f2ccf723bbb3957a423fc032494
```

## Build
All Makefiles are configured for MinGW (and obviously only for Windows).

When you call `build` target, compiler will build lua sources from `src/lua5.1_tw` and the library files. After that you will find `md5.dll` under path `build\md5.dll`.

```powershell
mingw32-make.exe build
```

You can test the built library by calling `test`.


```powershell
mingw32-make.exe test
```



> **Note:** To create the `md5.dll` file, we need `lua51.dll` and the source header files. I don't know how to get them from the game (haha), so I tried to build new ones from the default Lua sources. Therefore, the library comes with modified Lua5.1.5 sources that will need to be built before building the library itself. The only change in the source codes is that the lua type `number` is defined as `float` instead of `double` to be closer to Lua shipped with game.

## History

### Version 2.0.0 [11/Apr/2023] 

Initial release of forked version. 

Key differences from original (v1.2):
1. Support only Lua 5.1 and Windows
2. Removed all non-digest related features
3. Fixed iterative calculation of MD5 checksums (should work now)
4. Provided `MD5Context` class in Lua to encapsulate iterative checksum calculations

### Version 1.2 [06/Sep/2013]

* Code adapted to compile for Lua 5.0, 5.1 and 5.2

### Version 1.1.2 [12/May/2008]

* Fixed bug in 64-bit systems
* Fixed the Windows makefile to accept longer directory names
  (patch by Alessandro Hecht and Ignacio BurgueÃ±o).
